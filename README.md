Working upgrade copy of obsoletc COPS form Dan Farmer
-----------------------------------------------------

Decades ago, Dan farmer wrot a lightweight and flexible security
analysis tool. It's also been unmaintained for years, but a few folks
use it in legacy environments.

I've tweaked the 1.0.4 source code from OpenBSD for RHEL compatibility,
and for more recent makefile and libc syntax.
